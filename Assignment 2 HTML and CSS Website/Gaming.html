  <h3 style="color:black">What's the Point?</h3>
  <p>
    Gaming has acted as support through my studies as from gaming, I am able to offset stress by taking a break. Contrary to 
    stereotypical gamers, I am a strategical gamer who enjoys more strategical games whether its in skill or being a tactician.
    Each Game on the list has different concepts or mechanics that have influenced my values and general attitude towards life. 
    It can also be a form of escapism when things are getting heated or tiring in which i can completely immerse myself in a world 
    that i can control. Personally, i am into games that have elements of strategy or deducting situations since it challenges my sense 
    of mind and emphasises the importance of always being aware. The list below are more large scale games that are more well-known. 
    Honourable Mentions are Fall Guys, any Mario Game, Town of Salem (Excellent Psychology Game), Nonogram, 4 in a row and Minesweeper. 
    From playing my favourite my games, i have learnt to be more supportive to other people, teamwork skills, analysing strengths and 
    weaknesses, planning ahead, acute listening skills, patience and most importantly, maintaining respect with people overall.

  <h3 style="color:white">League of Legends</h3>
</a>
    <p>
      League of Legends is a team-based strategy game of the MOBA Genere in which two teams of five champions face off to destroy the other team's base.
      As of now there are 150 Champions with a variety of unique abilities, playstyles and thematic stories. The main Satisfaction of the game is being able to make
      big plays and exerting your skill as a player. I first started out in Season 5 (2014) and have been fascinated with the game since then. As of playstyle, 
      I am a flexible player who can do well in all lanes. In the Top Lane, I like to play tanky bruisers such as Garen and Shen as they can help the team win. In the Jungle, 
      I play Master Yi for the Carry Potential, and Hecarim for the Gank threat. In the Mid lane, i play Ekko for the outplays and Swain for the dominance. As ADC,
      I play Jhin as his thematics and accurate playstyle is excellent and Lucian for his outplay potential and his Mobility.
      Currently, I play support more often with Pyke and Thresh since they can make or break teamfights and have significant influence of the game.
      Overall, my favourite part about of League of Legends isn't the game itself, but watching it grow through new content such as champions, new skins and new cinematics

  <h3 style="color:black">Teamfight Tactics</h3>
  </a> 
    <p>
      Teamfight Tactics is a new entry in a new game genre: Auto Chess. The original Auto Chess entry was released in January 2019. Since then, it’s seen a huge rise in popularity. The simple and engaging gameplay of the genre rewards both skill and game knowledge but also allows for luck and the use of clever strategies to secure victory. This makes it appealing for players of all abilities.
  
      As a multiplayer game that doesn’t demand split-second decision-making or god-like actions per minute (APM), autobattlers are easy to play.
      
      In TFT, Riot has leveraged its sizeable existing cast of characters (champions) as pieces or units in the game and using its current League of Legends player base as its beta testers. With these resources, they can release frequent updates, while remaining strategically interesting, yet simple enough that even a first-time player has the potential for victory.

      This is one of my favourite games because it requires alot of creative strategy that i enjoy and also because its the only game in which i can say that i'm truly good at since i've reached a high rank (Diamond IV) and i have alot of knowledge about.

  <h3 style="color:white">TEAM FORTRESS 2</h3>
  </a>
    <p>
        Team Fortress 2 is a free game on Steam and is one of the most memorable First Person Shooter games in gaming history.
        It has 9 classes which utilise unique weapons and play styles. We have the Scout, a fast mercenary from boston who has a
        in your face hit and run personality. The Soldier, a true patriot of America who isn't that smart, but makes up in good health, and rocket power. 
        The Pyro, a mysterious psychopath with a flamethrower, but in reality is literally in a new world.
        The Demoman, a drunk, one eyed scottish man who specialises in sticky bombs and charging into enemies.
        The Heavy, a russian bald muscly man who uses his gun Sasha to mow down anyone who would hurt his friends or his sandvich.
        The Engineer, the soft spoken Texas who builds dispensers, teleporters and sentries to provide support to his teammates.
        The Medic, a crazy german doctor who heals his teammates and honestly has no idea if his experiments will ever work.
        The Sniper, an Outback Australian living in his Van who takes opportunistic shots to cripple the enemy team.
        And the Spy, a french saboteur who likes to stealthily backstab enemies and dresses himself as sharp as his knives.
        My favourite part about TF2 is its community and its friendly vibe ingame via interactive taunts and its goofy characters.

  <h3 style="color:black">POKEMON SWORD AND SHIELD</h3>
  </a>
    <p>
      Pokemon Sword and Shield is a role-playing game in which you are a young Pokemon trainer aiming to become 
      the Pokemon Champion. The Main Objective is to dethrone the Pokemon Champion Leon, a powerful trainer who has
      never lost before. You will be battling Pokemon Gym Leaders, trainers, Team Yell and encounter fateful battles
      with the legendary pokemons Eternatus, Zacian and Zamazenta. This iteration of Pokemon is based on the United 
      Kingdom and introduces 81 new Pokemon alongside 13 unique regional variants. Out of all my favourite games, this
      is one of the most meaningful ones as i have made alot of good connections and helped many people in the online community. 
      With the introduction of Max Raid Battles, trainers are able to team up to defeat a Giant pokemon and catch it together. 
      However, many exploits have risen allowing for the shiny variations to be caught easily (Before it was 1/512 chance at random). Since
      Square Shiny Pokemon are so rare, hosting one is prestigious and many people look up to and respect these hosters. As a result,
      i bought a Uno r3 Arduino in order to automate the processes allowing for it to be done alot faster. From the Purchase, 
      i was able to help other players catch the shiny variation of their favourite pokemon. As a result, Pokemon Sword is a game
      i hold special in my collection.

  <h3 style="color:white">SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE</h3>
  </a>
    <p>
        Super Smash Bros Ultimate is a 2018 crossover fighting game which incorporates different characters such as Mario from his seriers, 
        to Sonic from the Sega Franchise. It is the best selling fighting game of all time, selling over 20 million copies over 2 years.
        The game features up to 8 players battling each other as Nintendo characters and other third-party franchises by 
        knocking each other out of the stage/arena. The main fun comes from the players skill to utilise combos, strategies and mechanics to
        their fullest potential. Currently, there are 74 characters with unique moves and playstyles that anyone can find interesting. 
        My favourite 3 characters currently are Donkey Kong, Chrom and Ganondorf since they have good moves in the air and have playstyles that i 
        enjoy playing. Overall, Smash Ultimate is a game that is super fun and is a good ice breaker at parties or fun events.
