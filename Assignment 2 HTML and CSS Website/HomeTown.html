    <p style="font-size: 14pt">
      Cabramatta is located in south-western Sydney and is a part of the City of Fairfield Council.
      More known as Cabra, it is the largest Vietnamese community in Australia and is scattered with many
      asian cuisine places from many countires such as Vietnam, Thailand, China and Cambodia. I have been living
      here my whole life and its well known for its melting pot of culture and cuisine. Since the crackdown
      on gangs and drugs in 2002, the place has been upgraded and modernised. With each new Generation of residents
      Cabramatta continues to be a great place to hang out with friends and family as memorable places slowly get
      replaced
      with new faces. With the help of community projects and the government, it has become a good tourist place for
      asian
      visitors and is the host to the yearly Moon Festival.

    <h3 style="color:white">GOUGH WHITLAM PLACE</h3>
    <p>
      On June 2016, in Dutton Plaza, a three-storey building was built and Fairfield Council funded
      and bought retail development by replacing the existing council owned car pack. In doing so, 31 retail places
      were opened up with the first floor being four offices and the second and third floors being extra car park
      for residents and workers. Since the replacement of the place, the traffic has significantly improved
      and many people have maintained very successful and memorable businesses there. The public
      open space at the front entrance was name Gough Whitlam Place in honour of Gough Whitlam who represented
      Cabramatta. many cafes have been established there and many older aged citizens come together to watch each other
      play
      Chinese Chess. Since the establishment of this venue, Cabramatta has become more popular and more attractive
      overall.

    <p>
      The Cabramatta Moon Festival is a yearly tradition that celebrates the full moon with a variety of spectacular
      events.
      The date is determined by the equinox in which the length of day and night are equal. During the festival, many
      streets that connect within Cabramatta are shut off and are filled with stalls selling a wide variety of
      traditional
      accessories, clothes, toys, treats and bags for everyone to enjoy. Some stall give out free food symbolising the
      diversity and vitality of the asian culture. During this time, many performances can occur such as the traditional
      lion
      dancing, musical performances, stunts from Parkour/Tricking communities INVINCIBLE group and Team9Lives as well as
      traditional dancing. They also hire numerous playplaces and rides for children and the family to enjoy. To end of
      the
      day, a spectacular collection of fireworks are displayed signalling the reckoning of luckiness, wealth and good
      health.
