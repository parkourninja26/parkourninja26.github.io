     <h3 style="color:black">Definition of Programming?</h3> 
      <p>  
        Programming is the process of creating instructions and rules that allows a computer to perform a task. 
        There are a variety of programming languages used such as Python, Java, HTML, Javascript, C++, C#, PHP and SQL.
        In the Programming world, there are 2 main categories of speciality, the front end and back end. 
        The front end specialises in optimising human to computer synergy through enhancement in business processes,
        Graphical User Interfaces and User requirements. On the otherhand, the Back end specialises
        upon delivering the logical processes and server side and involves enhancing code using mathematics and 
        logical algorithms to deliver content. Through the synergie of both sides, an entire project can be generated 
        through active communication and teamwork effort.

        <h3 style="color:white">How do I approach it </h3>
        <p>
         Programming itself is just learning a new language that can be applied to many different applications and can be 
         used to develop exciting projects or making your life easier by creating useful programs. When i first started programming, 
         I dreaded it because the amount of theory and coding terminologies was overwhelming. At first introduction, simple concepts such 
         as Accessors, Mutators, ArrayLists and other coding fundamentals didn't mean anything but weird terminology. Through the 
         constant cycle of being confused and frustrated with learning the fundamentals. I came to a realisation that learning programming 
         terminology didn't mean anything if i didn't know how to apply it. From this Epiphany, i started to experiment with all the concepts 
         through creating my own mini programs. Hour by hour of experimenting how each keywords and concepts worked, it began to seep into my 
         mind faster and faster. Soon enough, i was able to remember code functions and what they did without looking at Theory. 
         Once that had occured, i began to reread my programming notes and it all made much more sense. From my research, the best way to 
         learn programming is to have the ability to experiment and create a program that you will enjoy making and incorporating the keyword concepts 
         into the code. Since the times i've procastinated coding, i've spent around 2-3 hrs per day looking at sample tutorial codes and code online 
         and inheriting into my own and fully dedicating my time to understanding the code.

        <p>
          In the example below, i have utilised the Tutorial Code and created a new code that simulates the store of 
          a game i know of. By augmenting this code, i am able to learn what each component of the tutorial code and shift in 
          such a way it works. For example, in the Tutorial Code, i have substituted the Movie tab with a champ tab as they 
          function similarly. From understanding the core components of the tutorial code, i am able to inherit an understand its purpose 
          and manipulate in order to create a personal project code that i can use as future reference or revision.
